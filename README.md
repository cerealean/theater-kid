## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/cerealean/theater-kid)

Get started instantly with a fully configured Angular development environment in the cloud:

1. Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge above
2. Wait for the environment to initialize (dependencies install automatically)
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Your Angular app will be available at the forwarded port

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
