## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/cerealean/theater-kid)

Get started instantly with a fully configured Angular development environment in the cloud:

1. Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge above
2. Wait for the environment to initialize (dependencies install automatically)
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Your Angular app will be available at the forwarded port

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Code Quality & Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Angular ESLint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) for code quality.

### Linting

To check for code quality issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues where possible:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Code Formatting

To format all source files:

```bash
npm run format
```

To check if files are properly formatted:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Run all quality checks, build, and tests (as used in CI):

```bash
npm run ci
```

This command runs:

1. ESLint for code quality
2. Prettier format check
3. Build verification
4. Unit tests

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses separate GitHub Actions workflows for pull requests and releases:

### CI Workflow (Pull Requests and Main Branch)

The CI workflow runs on every push and pull request and includes:

1. âœ… Checks code formatting with Prettier
2. âœ… Runs ESLint for code quality
3. âœ… Builds the application
4. âœ… Runs unit tests
5. âœ… Uploads build artifacts

### Release Workflow (Main Branch Only)

When code is pushed to the main branch and CI passes, a separate release workflow runs:

1. âœ… Performs semantic versioning analysis
2. âœ… Updates CHANGELOG.md and package.json
3. âœ… Creates GitHub releases
4. âœ… Rebuilds the application with updated version
5. âœ… Uploads release build artifacts

Pull requests must pass all CI checks before they can be merged.

## Additional Resources

For more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

## Development Workflow

This project uses **Commitlint** and **Husky** to ensure clean commits and maintain code quality.

### Making Commits

Use standard git commit commands with conventional commit message format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

All commit messages are automatically validated against conventional commit standards.

### Pre-commit Hooks

The following checks run automatically:

- **Pre-commit**: Prettier formatting on all staged files
- **Commit-msg**: Conventional commit message validation

### Available Scripts

- `npm run prepare` - Install husky hooks (runs automatically after npm install)
